When we run the application the Login Page is first sited, but we didn't register in the system yet so we need to Signup first.

1. Signup:

![Signup Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105460398/168178351-a03b10ff-d8a3-4c14-8e47-736aeb89cf63.jpg)

In the Signup Page we fill up the information required and we have to take in mind the restrictions of some attribute.
1. 1. We have to enter a valid email (contains '.com','@',no spaces etc...).
   2. We have to enter a valid username (contains only Letters,Digits,'-','.',' _ ').
   3. We have to enter a valid password: ![Password Conditions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105460398/168179354-9e67c15c-c5e0-4eb3-b166-0c0fb2267046.jpeg)
   If any of the required was not applied a Label in red would be set Visible under the textfield that didn't apply one of its conditions.
   (Note : our system deals with dates perfectly as for which months have different days from the rest and as for which year the second month would have 29 or 28 days).
